Meet our Project Partner, Artsolute! In this video, we'll be chatting with Terence, Founder and Director of Artsolute.

&nbsp;

Founded in 2011, Artsolute is a non-profit organisation that aims to raise a caring and active society through the arts. It has been involved with various communities and has rich experience working with a diversity of stakeholders, artists and organisations locally and internationally to deliver projects that are truly impactful and sustainable.

&nbsp;

Specific to Pulau Ubin, they are familiar faces on the island, volunteering over the past 5 years to support the heritage and the community of Ubin using community projects and the arts. Their efforts have shown how art is a great way to bring residents and volunteers together while protecting the rich heritage and way of life for the communities on Ubin.

&nbsp;

Weâ€™ve definitely learnt a lot from Terence with his many insights, and we are excited to work closely with Artsolute in the coming months.
